name: create-slide
description: Use this skill when the user wants to create, draft, author, or generate new slides / a presentation in this open-slide repo. Triggers on phrases like "make slides about X", "create a presentation", "draft slides for", "new slide", or when the user asks to add content under `slides/`. Do NOT use for editing the framework itself — only for authoring content inside `slides/<id>/`.

# Create a slide in open-slide

This skill owns the **workflow** for drafting a new deck. The technical reference — file contract, 1920×1080 canvas, type scale, palette, layout, assets — lives in the **`slide-authoring`** skill. Read that skill whenever you need details on *how* a page is structured. This skill assumes you'll consult it before writing code.

You only write files under `slides/<id>/`. Never modify `package.json`, `open-slide.config.ts`, or existing slides.

## Step 1 — Pick a theme

List files under `themes/`. If any theme markdown files exist (anything other than `README.md`), call `AskUserQuestion` with each theme id as an option plus a final **"no theme — design from scratch"** option.

- If the user picks a theme: read `themes/<id>.md` end-to-end. The theme's palette, typography, layout, and Title/Footer components are now authoritative — copy them directly into the slide. In Step 2, you can skip the **topic & aesthetic** question (the theme already commits to one direction); still ask about page count, text density, and motion since those are independent of theme.
- If the user picks "no theme", or `themes/` is empty (or contains only `README.md`): proceed to Step 2 unchanged.

If you skip the aesthetic question because a theme was picked, restate the theme name in Step 2 so the user can correct course before you start writing.

## Step 2 — Clarify requirements (MUST ask before writing code)

**Before doing anything else, call `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the four key style decisions below.** These shape every downstream choice (layout, type scale, asset needs, motion code), so locking them in up front avoids rework. Only skip a question when the user's original message already gave an unambiguous answer for it — and if you skip, restate your assumption so they can correct it.

Ask these four in a single `AskUserQuestion` call (multi-question form):

1. **Topic & aesthetic** — what is this slide about, and what visual direction? Offer options like: minimal editorial, playful, corporate-clean, retro, brutalist, soft/pastel, dark neon. If they have no preference, propose one.
2. **Page count** — rough length. Offer brackets: 3–5 (short), 6–10 (standard), 11–20 (deep dive), custom.
3. **Text density per page** — how much copy lives on each page? Offer: minimal (one line / big number), light (heading + 2–3 bullets), standard (heading + 4–5 bullets or short paragraph), dense (multi-column / detailed). This directly drives type scale and layout.
4. **Motion** — does the user want CSS/React animations and transitions, or a fully static deck? Offer: static (no motion), subtle (fades / entrance only), rich (keyframes, staggered reveals, looping visuals). If animated, plan to use CSS `@keyframes` / inline `style` + `useEffect`; no extra libraries.

After those four, ask follow-ups **only if still unclear**: audience, any drafted outline/content, brand colors, required assets. Don't pad the conversation with questions already answered.

## Step 3 — Pick a slide id

Use **kebab-case**, short, descriptive. Examples: `rust-intro`, `q2-roadmap`, `team-offsite-2026`. Check `slides/` to avoid collisions.

## Step 4 — Plan the structure

Sketch the slide as a list of page roles before writing code. Common page types:

| Role             | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cover            | Title + subtitle, strong visual               |
| Agenda           | What's coming (3–5 items)                     |
| Section divider  | Big label between chapters                    |
| Content          | Heading + 2–5 bullets OR heading + one visual |
| Big number       | One statistic the size of the canvas          |
| Quote            | Pull-quote with attribution                   |
| Comparison       | Two-column before/after or A vs B             |
| Closing          | CTA, thanks, contact                          |

**Rule of thumb**: one idea per page. If you're tempted to put two, split them.

If the deck topic naturally calls for specific real images the user must supply (product screenshots, team photos, customer dashboards), plan where those go and use `<ImagePlaceholder>` from `@open-slide/core` — see the **Image placeholders** section in `slide-authoring`. Default is **no placeholders**: only insert one when a real image is genuinely required.

## Step 5 — Commit to a visual direction

Pick one coherent palette / type scale / aesthetic and hold it across every page. The full set of constraints (palette structure, type scale, padding, aesthetic options) lives in `slide-authoring` — apply it.

**Default: declare a top-level `export const design: DesignSystem = { … }`** at the top of `index.tsx` (after imports) using the chosen palette / type scale, and reference the values via `var(--osd-X)` from inline styles. This keeps the slide tweakable from the Design panel after generation, which is what the user almost always wants. Only skip the `design` const for a one-off slide whose palette is intentionally locked and not meant to be re-themed — in that case, fall back to the local `palette` constants pattern. The "Design system" section of `slide-authoring` covers the format and available tokens.

Consult the `frontend-design` skill for deeper aesthetic guidance if the user wants something bold.

## Step 6 — Write `slides/<id>/index.tsx`

Read the **`slide-authoring`** skill before writing — it covers the file contract, canvas rules, type scale, spacing, and asset imports, and it includes a starter template you can copy. Don't duplicate that knowledge here; use it.

## Step 7 — Self-review

Run the checklist in `slide-authoring` ("Self-review before finishing"). It covers structural correctness, layout discipline, and asset existence.

## Step 8 — Hand off to the user

Tell the user:

- The slide id and file path you created.
- That the dev server will hot-reload — they can open `http://localhost:5173/s/<id>` (or refresh the home page).
- If dev isn't running: `pnpm dev` from the repo root.

Don't run the dev server yourself unless asked.
