# @open-slide/cli

Scaffold a Master Of Slide workspace, based on the [open-slide](https://github.com/1weiho/open-slide) source, with agent skills preconfigured.

## Usage

```bash
npx @open-slide/cli init my-slide
cd my-slide
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This creates a workspace containing:

- `slides/getting-started/` — a starter slide you can edit or delete.
- `package.json` — depends on `@open-slide/core`, which provides the runtime (home page, slide viewer, fullscreen mode) and the `open-slide` CLI.
- `open-slide.config.ts` — optional typed config (slidesDir, port, lang).
- `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` — Claude Code skills (`create-slide`, `apply-comments`, …).
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent guide for authoring slides.

You won't see any Vite, React, or tsconfig files in the workspace. They live inside `@open-slide/core` and you never touch them.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `open-slide init [dir]` | Scaffold a new workspace in `dir` (defaults to current dir). |
| `open-slide init --force` | Scaffold into a non-empty directory. |
| `open-slide init --name <name>` | Override the generated `package.json` name. |

(Once installed in the workspace, `@open-slide/core` provides `open-slide dev`, `open-slide build`, and `open-slide preview` via its own bin.)

For Korean decks, set `lang: 'ko'` in `open-slide.config.ts` so preview and
exports use Korean-friendly language metadata, font fallback, and line breaking.

## Authoring

Inside the scaffolded workspace, slides live under `slides/<kebab-case-id>/index.tsx` and default-export an array of `Page` components. Each page renders into a fixed 1920×1080 canvas; the framework handles scaling.

Ask Claude Code to "make slides about X" and the `create-slide` skill will take it from there.
Give it a Markdown or Obsidian note path and use `create-slide-from-markdown`
to turn the note into a deck; the skill can also use generated bitmap assets
when the agent environment supports image generation.

The browser download menu can export the result as HTML, PDF, or PPTX. PPTX
export uses one full-slide image per page to preserve the React design.
In dev, Canva handoff is also available from the download menu after setting
`CANVA_CLIENT_ID` and `CANVA_CLIENT_SECRET` for a Canva Connect API app.
