# Create a slide from Markdown / Obsidian

This workflow turns a local `.md` note into an open-slide deck. It extends
`create-slide`; when writing React, follow `slide-authoring`.

You only write files under `slides/<id>/`. Never modify the source note.

## Inputs

The user should provide a local Markdown path. If they also provide audience,
page count, language, tone, or visual direction, treat those as authoritative.
If not, infer conservative defaults and ask only for missing decisions that
would materially change the deck.

For Obsidian notes, support common syntax:

- YAML frontmatter: use `title`, `aliases`, `tags`, `summary` if present.
- Headings: treat as the primary outline.
- Lists and paragraphs: summarize, do not paste everything.
- Callouts (`> [!note]`, `> [!warning]`): convert to emphasized slides or sidebars.
- Wikilinks (`[[Note]]`, `[[Note|Label]]`): render the label as text unless the linked note is explicitly needed.
- Embeds (`![[image.png]]`, `![[note#Heading]]`): resolve image/video assets relative to the note or vault when possible; otherwise use a placeholder.
- Code blocks, tables, Mermaid, and math: preserve only when they are central to the talk. Otherwise summarize.

## Workflow

1. Read the Markdown file.
2. Identify the likely vault/root directory from the file path. Use it to resolve relative links and Obsidian embeds.
3. Extract:
   - title
   - one-sentence thesis
   - audience / intent clues
   - major sections
   - key claims, examples, and data points
   - assets referenced by embeds or Markdown image links
4. Create a slide plan with one idea per page. Prefer 6-12 pages unless the user requested otherwise.
5. Choose a slide id from the note title in kebab-case. Use romanized or English ids for Korean titles.
6. Create `slides/<id>/index.tsx` and copy any resolved local assets into `slides/<id>/assets/`.
7. Use Korean-friendly defaults when the source note or user request is Korean:
   - `lang: 'ko'` should be present in `open-slide.config.ts` already; do not edit it from this skill.
   - font stack: `"Pretendard", "Noto Sans KR", "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Malgun Gothic", system-ui, sans-serif`.
   - use `wordBreak: 'keep-all'`, `overflowWrap: 'anywhere'`, and line-height >= 1.35 for body copy.
8. Self-review with `slide-authoring`.

## AI-generated images

If the deck would benefit from a conceptual hero image, texture, diagram-like
visual, or chapter artwork, and the current Codex environment offers image
generation, generate bitmap assets and save them under `slides/<id>/assets/`.

Rules:

- Generate images only when they improve the deck, not for every page.
- Prefer 16:9 images for full-bleed slides and transparent PNG cutouts for objects.
- Keep prompts concrete and tied to the source note's meaning.
- Do not generate images that pretend to be real screenshots, real charts,
  private people, internal documents, or brand assets. Use `ImagePlaceholder`
  for those instead.
- After generating or copying an asset, import it from `./assets/...` and render
  with ordinary `<img>` tags.
- If image generation is unavailable, use `ImagePlaceholder` with a precise hint
  so the user can replace it later through the Assets panel.

## Output

Tell the user:

- source Markdown path used
- slide id and created path
- how many pages were generated
- which assets were copied, generated, or left as placeholders
- preview URL: `http://localhost:5173/s/<id>`
